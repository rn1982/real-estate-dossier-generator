title: "Professional PDF Generation with React-PDF"

summary: |
  Story 2.4 has been successfully implemented with good quality. The React-PDF integration 
  delivers on all critical acceptance criteria. However, there are notable concerns:
  - 1 ESLint error in api/generate-pdf.js (function declaration issue)
  - 20 ESLint warnings (mostly TypeScript 'any' types)
  - Multiple test failures in dossier API integration tests
  The dual-mode architecture with triple fallback strategy exceeds requirements.

    - "‚úÖ Performance optimized"
    - "‚úÖ Fallback strategies tested"
    - "‚ùå Integration tests must pass"
    - "‚ùå ESLint error must be fixed"

    - "‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript 'any' types should be replaced"

conclusion: |
  Story 2.4 is a GOOD implementation that successfully addresses the critical issues 
  from Story 2.3 (layout problems, large files, server timeouts). The React-PDF integration 
  works well with good architecture and Swiss market support.
  
  However, there are quality concerns that should be addressed:
  - 11 integration test failures indicate potential API issues
  - 1 ESLint error and 20 warnings reduce code quality
  - TypeScript 'any' usage undermines type safety
  
  RECOMMENDATION: Fix the ESLint error and failing integration tests before production 
  deployment. The PDF generation functionality itself appears solid, but the API 
  integration issues could cause problems in production.
