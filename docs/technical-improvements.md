# Technical Improvements Backlog

## Overview
This document tracks technical improvements and optimizations identified during development and QA reviews that are not blocking but should be addressed in future iterations.

## Improvements from Story 1.1 Review

### 1. Button Component HMR Optimization
**Issue**: Fast refresh warning in `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
**Details**: The Button component exports both the component and type definitions, which affects hot module replacement performance
**Recommendation**: 
- Separate type exports into a dedicated types file (e.g., `Button.types.ts`)
- Keep only the component export in `Button.tsx`
**Priority**: Low
**Impact**: Developer experience during development
**Reference**: Story 1.1 QA Review (2025-08-26)

### 2. Test Coverage Expansion
**Issue**: Limited test coverage with only `App.test.tsx`
**Details**: Current test suite only covers the main App component
**Recommendation**:
- Add unit tests for individual components as they are created
- Implement integration tests for user flows
- Add test coverage for utility functions and services
- Target 80% code coverage on critical paths
**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Code quality and regression prevention

## Implementation Guidelines

These improvements should be considered when:
1. Working on related components or areas
2. During dedicated technical debt sprints
3. As part of regular refactoring activities
4. When implementing new features that touch these areas

## Notes
- These are non-blocking improvements that passed QA review
- Implementation is at the discretion of the development team
- Should be revisited periodically during sprint planning
