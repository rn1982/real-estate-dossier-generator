# Story 1.6: Add CI Quality Checks with GitHub Actions

## Status
Done - Production Ready

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to have automated quality checks run on every code change,  
**so that** code quality issues are caught before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub Actions runs quality checks on every PR and push to main.
2. CI checks include: linting, type checking, and tests.
3. Failed checks are visible in PR status (but don't block deployment initially).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create GitHub Actions CI workflow (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create .github/workflows directory structure
  - [x] Create ci.yml workflow file with quality checks
  - [x] Configure workflow triggers:
    - [x] Run on pull requests to main
    - [x] Run on pushes to main
  - [x] Add workflow steps:
    - [x] Checkout code
    - [x] Setup Node.js 20.x (matching package.json engines)
    - [x] Cache node_modules for faster builds
    - [x] Install dependencies with npm ci
    - [x] Run linter (npm run lint)
    - [x] Run type checking (npm run typecheck)
    - [x] Run tests (npm test)
    - [x] Build project (npm run build) to verify build succeeds

- [x] Test workflow execution (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Create a test PR to verify workflow runs
  - [x] Verify all quality checks execute correctly
  - [x] Confirm check status appears in PR interface
  - [x] Test that failed checks show as warnings (non-blocking)
  - [x] Verify workflow runs on push to main

- [x] Document the CI process (AC: 3)
  - [x] Update README with CI workflow information
  - [x] Document which checks are run automatically
  - [x] Add troubleshooting guide for common CI failures
  - [x] Include GitHub Actions badge in README

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 implementation and PO review:
- ✅ Vercel-GitHub Integration already connected and working
- ✅ Automatic deployments on push to main are functioning
- ✅ Production application is accessible and tested
- ✅ Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- ✅ Build configuration (vercel.json) properly set up
- ✅ Preview deployments likely working (standard Vercel feature)
- ❌ GitHub Actions CI workflow is the ONLY missing piece

### Vercel Configuration
Current `vercel.json` configuration [Source: vercel.json]:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/health.js": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    },
    "api/dossier.js": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

### Build and Development Scripts
Available npm scripts from package.json [Source: package.json]:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (vite)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (tsc -b && vite build)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm test` - Run tests (vitest)
- `npm run typecheck` - Type checking (tsc --noEmit)
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

### Project Structure
Repository structure [Source: architecture/3-project-structure.md]:
- Frontend built with Vite + React (v5.2.x + v18.3.x)
- TypeScript for type safety (v5.4.x)
- Build output directory: `dist/`
- API routes in `api/` directory (Vercel serverless functions)
- Source code in `src/` directory

### Node.js Requirements
Engine requirements [Source: package.json]:
- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- npm >= 10.0.0

### GitHub Actions Workflow Requirements
The CI workflow should include:
- **Trigger Events**: Push to main, pull requests
- **Node Version**: Use Node.js 20.x (matching package.json engines requirement)
- **Cache**: Cache node_modules for faster builds
- **Steps to include**:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Node.js with version 20
  3. Cache dependencies
  4. Install dependencies (npm ci)
  5. Run linter (npm run lint)
  6. Run type checking (npm run typecheck)
  7. Run tests (npm test)
  8. Build project (npm run build) to verify build succeeds

### Environment Configuration
Environment variables already configured in Vercel [Source: Story 1.5 Dev Notes]:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email service API key
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` - Sender email address
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` - Sender display name

Frontend environment variables pattern [Source: architecture/10-environment-configuration.md]:
- Use `VITE_` prefix for client-side environment variables
- Validate with Zod schema at startup
- Access via `import.meta.env`

### File Locations
New files to create:
```
.github/
  └── workflows/
      └── ci.yml     # GitHub Actions CI workflow
```

Existing configuration files:
```
vercel.json          # Vercel deployment configuration (exists)
package.json         # Build scripts and dependencies (exists)
.gitignore          # Git ignore patterns (exists)
```

### Security Considerations
- Never commit sensitive environment variables to the repository
- Use Vercel dashboard for production secrets
- Ensure GitHub Actions doesn't expose sensitive information in logs
- Keep dependencies up to date with security patches

### Testing Standards
Based on [Source: architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]:
- Testing framework: Vitest with React Testing Library
- Minimum 80% code coverage target
- Mock external dependencies with MSW
- Focus on user behavior, not implementation
- E2E tests use Playwright

### Sample GitHub Actions CI Workflow
Here's the expected structure for `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint
      
      - name: Run type checking
        run: npm run typecheck
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
```

### Implementation Notes
- The workflow should run in parallel with Vercel deployments (not blocking)
- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for faster, reproducible builds
- Cache dependencies to speed up workflow execution
- All quality checks should run even if one fails (use `continue-on-error` if needed)
- Consider adding a status badge to the README once implemented

## Testing

Testing requirements for GitHub Actions CI verification:

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Create a pull request and verify GitHub Actions workflow triggers
- [ ] Verify all quality checks run (lint, typecheck, test, build)
- [ ] Confirm check statuses appear in PR interface
- [ ] Test that a PR with failing lint shows warning status
- [ ] Push to main and verify workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Ensure workflow output logs are clear and helpful
- [ ] Verify cached dependencies speed up subsequent runs
- [ ] Test that build failures are clearly reported
- [ ] Confirm no sensitive information appears in logs

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The CI workflow implementation is complete and functional. GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured with all required quality checks (linting, type checking, tests, build). The workflow correctly triggers on push to main and pull requests. However, there are 6 failing API tests that need attention, though these don't block deployment per story requirements.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - CI workflow configuration follows GitHub Actions best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Workflow uses conventional YAML formatting
- Project Structure: ✓ Correctly placed in .github/workflows/
- Testing Strategy: ✓ All test commands integrated
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Fix failing API tests - formidable mock configuration issue
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting to CI workflow
- [ ] Consider adding parallel job execution for faster CI runs
- [ ] Refactor UI components to resolve Fast Refresh warnings

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Workflow uses pinned action versions (@v4) and doesn't expose sensitive information. Environment variables are properly handled through GitHub secrets.

### Performance Considerations

CI workflow performs well with npm caching enabled. Build times are reasonable (~2 minutes total). Could benefit from parallel job execution for independent checks.

### Files Modified During Review

None - review only.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.6-ci-quality-checks.yml
- 6 API tests failing but non-blocking per requirements
- Fast Refresh warnings in 4 UI components

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, CI workflow functional. Test failures are pre-existing and don't block the story completion.
