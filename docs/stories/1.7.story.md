# Story 1.7: Configure Error Tracking

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to integrate a lightweight error tracking service (e.g., Sentry),  
**so that** we are proactively alerted to any production bugs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An error tracking service SDK is added to the project.
2. The service is initialized with a key from environment variables.
3. A test error is successfully captured in the service's dashboard.

  - [x] Evaluate Sentry, LogRocket, and Bugsnag for Vercel/React compatibility
  - [x] Consider free tier limits and pricing for MVP
  - [x] Verify service works with Vercel serverless functions and React frontend
  - [x] Make final selection decision

- [x] Set up error tracking service account and obtain credentials (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create account with selected provider
  - [x] Generate API key/DSN credentials
  - [x] Add credentials to Vercel environment variables

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6 implementation:
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI workflow is configured and working
- ✅ Vercel-GitHub integration is functioning with automatic deployments
- ✅ Environment variables are properly configured in Vercel dashboard
- ✅ Build and deployment processes are stable
- ⚠️ 6 API tests currently failing but development workflow is established

From Story 1.5 implementation:
- ✅ Email service (Resend) integration is working and provides a model for external service integration
- ✅ Environment variable pattern established with Vercel dashboard configuration
- ✅ Error handling patterns exist in API routes (api/dossier.js, api/emailService.js)

### Technology Stack Context
**Frontend Stack** [Source: architecture/2-frontend-tech-stack.md]:
- React 18.3.x with TypeScript 5.4.x
- Vite 5.2.x as build tool
- Environment variables accessed via `import.meta.env` with `VITE_` prefix

**Backend Stack** [Source: package.json]:
- Node.js >=20.0.0 running on Vercel serverless functions
- Existing API routes: `/api/health.js`, `/api/dossier.js`
- Formidable for multipart form handling
- Resend for email service integration

### Environment Configuration
**Environment Variable Pattern** [Source: architecture/10-environment-configuration.md]:
- Frontend: Use `VITE_` prefix for client-side variables
- Type-safe validation using Zod schema in `src/config/env.ts`
- Access via `import.meta.env`
- Backend: Standard Node.js `process.env` variables
- Production secrets managed through Vercel dashboard

**Existing Environment Variables** [Source: Story 1.5 Dev Notes]:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email service API key
- `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` - Sender email address
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` - Sender display name

### Project Structure
**File Locations** [Source: architecture/3-project-structure.md]:
- Configuration files: `src/config/` directory
- Environment validation: `src/config/env.ts`
- Application entry: `src/main.tsx`
- API routes: `api/` directory (Vercel serverless functions)
- Service functions: `src/services/` directory

### Error Tracking Integration Strategy

**Frontend Integration Points**:
- Initialize in `src/main.tsx` before React app mounting
- Add to environment schema in `src/config/env.ts`
- Consider React Error Boundaries for component-level error catching
- Integrate with existing form submission error handling

**Backend Integration Points**:
- Add to existing API routes (`api/health.js`, `api/dossier.js`)
- Wrap existing try/catch blocks with error tracking
- Include request context (user agent, IP, form data metadata)
- Maintain existing error response patterns

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]:
- Testing framework: Vitest with React Testing Library
- Mock external dependencies with MSW
- Minimum 80% code coverage target
- Focus on user behavior, not implementation

**Error Tracking Testing**:
- Mock error tracking service calls in tests
- Test error boundary components
- Verify error tracking initialization
- Test error reporting without actually sending to service

### Security Considerations
- Store error tracking credentials as environment variables
- Never expose sensitive data in error reports
- Sanitize form data before including in error context
- Use production vs development configuration
- Ensure error tracking doesn't log sensitive user information

### Performance Considerations
- Error tracking should not impact application performance
- Use asynchronous error reporting
- Consider sampling rates for high-volume errors
- Bundle size impact should be minimal

### Recommended Error Tracking Service
Based on architecture and existing integrations, **Sentry** is recommended because:
- Excellent React and Node.js support
- Free tier suitable for MVP
- Native Vercel integration available
- Comprehensive error context and debugging tools
- Established patterns and documentation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The error tracking implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with a well-structured integration of Sentry for both frontend and backend. The implementation demonstrates good security practices with sensitive data sanitization and appropriate environment-based configuration. However, the lack of automated test coverage for the error tracking components presents a maintainability concern.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - implementation is clean and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows TypeScript/JavaScript best practices and project conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed in config/, components/, and api/ directories
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing unit tests for error tracking components
- All ACs Met: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Add unit tests for Sentry configuration modules (api/sentryConfig.js, src/config/sentry.ts)
- [ ] Create tests for ErrorBoundary component behavior
- [ ] Mock Sentry in existing test suites to eliminate MSW warnings
- [ ] Add integration tests for test-error endpoint
- [ ] Consider implementing structured error codes for better categorization
- [ ] Add error tracking for form validation failures

### Security Review

✅ **PASS** - Excellent security implementation:
- Sensitive data (cookies, auth headers, passwords) properly filtered before sending to Sentry
- Environment-specific configuration prevents test data from reaching production
- Error messages in production hide technical details from users

### Performance Considerations

✅ **PASS** - Appropriate performance optimizations:
- Sampling rates configured (10% traces in production, 100% in development)
- Asynchronous error reporting prevents UI blocking
- Replay integration configured with appropriate sampling
- Bundle size impact minimal with tree-shaking

### Files Modified During Review

None - Implementation review only, no modifications required.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.7-error-tracking.yml
- Primary concern: Missing test coverage for error tracking components
- All functionality working as expected
- Security and performance requirements met

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Add test coverage before marking as Done

While the implementation successfully meets all functional requirements, the lack of automated tests for the error tracking integration reduces maintainability confidence. The story should remain in Review status until basic test coverage is added for the Sentry configuration and error handling components.
