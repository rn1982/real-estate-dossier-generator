### Important Context from Epic 2 Setup Guide

**Puppeteer Setup Requirements:**
- Use puppeteer-core with @sparticuz/chromium for Vercel compatibility
- Requires increased function memory (1024MB minimum) and timeout (30s)
- Vercel configuration needs updating for PDF generation endpoints
[Source: docs/epic-2-setup-guide.md#21-option-a-puppeteer-setup-recommended]

**React PDF Alternative:**
- @react-pdf/renderer provides pure Node.js PDF generation
- No browser dependencies, better for serverless
- Limited CSS support compared to HTML rendering
[Source: docs/epic-2-setup-guide.md#22-option-b-react-pdf-setup-alternative]

**External Service Option:**
- PDFShift or Carbone.io as managed services
- No infrastructure concerns but adds external dependency
- Cost per document needs evaluation
[Source: docs/epic-2-setup-guide.md#23-option-c-external-service-setup-fallback]

### HTML Template Requirements
Per the Epic 2 setup guide, the template must include:
1. Cover page with property hero image
2. Property overview with AI-generated narrative
3. Photo gallery section
4. Detailed property specifications
5. Agent contact information
[Source: docs/epic-2-setup-guide.md#step-3-html-template-creation]

### Performance Targets
- PDF generation time: < 5 seconds (target)
- Total request time including AI: < 15 seconds
- Memory usage: Within Vercel limits
[Source: docs/epic-2-setup-guide.md#monitoring--metrics]

### Vercel Configuration Requirements
```json
// vercel.json updates needed for PDF generation
{
  "functions": {
    "api/generate-pdf.js": {
      "maxDuration": 30,
      "memory": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

### Previous Story Insights (from Story 2.1)
- AI service successfully generating French content
- Property data structure established and working
- Gemini integration provides narrative and social media content
- Need to ensure PDF generation can handle French characters properly
- Consider using AI-generated content in prominent PDF sections

### Non-Blocking Issues from Epic 2 Transition
- Test suite has 42% failure rate but doesn't block PoC work
- Can proceed with PDF generation PoC independently
- Production health endpoint issue is non-critical
[Source: docs/epic-2-blockers-and-transition.md#non-blocking-issues]

## Testing

### Testing Standards (from Architecture)
- **Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: Tests go in `api/__tests__/poc/` directory
- **Naming Convention**: `{filename}.test.js`
- **Mocking**: Use MSW for external API mocking where applicable
- **Coverage Target**: PoC tests should validate core functionality
[Source: docs/architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]

### Required Test Cases
1. **HTML Template Tests**:
   - Verify template renders with sample data
   - Test handling of missing optional fields
   - Validate French character encoding

2. **PDF Generation Tests**:
   - Test successful PDF creation for each approach
   - Verify PDF contains expected content
   - Test error handling for invalid input
   - Measure generation time and memory usage

3. **Comparison Tests**:
   - Consistent test data across all PoCs
   - Same quality metrics applied
   - Performance benchmarks under load
