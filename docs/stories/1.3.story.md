# Story 1.3: Create Backend Endpoint to Receive Form Data

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a secure serverless endpoint that can receive the property data,  
**so that** the web form has a destination for the submitted information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new serverless function/endpoint is created to handle POST requests.
2. The endpoint is configured to receive multipart/form-data.
3. The endpoint successfully logs received text content and file metadata.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 implementation:
- DossierForm component successfully creates FormData object with all fields
- Form validation with Zod schema ensures data integrity before submission
- File upload component handles multiple files with proper type/size restrictions
- Form fields include: agentEmail, propertyType, address, price, roomCount, livingArea, constructionYear, keyPoints, propertyDescription, targetBuyer, photos array

### Serverless Function Structure
Based on existing health.js implementation [Source: /api/health.js]:

**Vercel Serverless Function Pattern**:
```javascript
export default function handler(req, res) {
  // Set CORS headers with origin validation
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGIN || '*')
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS')
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type')
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400') // Cache preflight for 24 hours
  
  // Handle OPTIONS for CORS preflight
  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    res.status(200).end()
    return
  }
  
  // Main logic here
}
```

### API Integration Pattern
Based on [Source: architecture/6-api-integration.md]:

**Service Function Template**:
```typescript
// src/services/dossierService.ts
import { DossierPostResponse } from '../types';

export const submitDossier = async (formData: FormData): Promise<DossierPostResponse> => {
  const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
  
  if (!apiUrl) {
    console.error("VITE_API_URL is not defined.");
    throw new Error("Application is not configured correctly.");
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/dossier`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`API request failed with status ${response.status}`);
  }
  
  return response.json();
};
```

### Form Data Structure
Based on [Source: src/types/dossierForm.ts from Story 1.2]:

Expected form fields to receive:
- **agentEmail**: string (required)
- **propertyType**: enum ["appartement", "maison"] (required)
- **address**: string (required)  
- **price**: string (required)
- **roomCount**: number (optional)
- **livingArea**: number (optional)
- **constructionYear**: number (optional)
- **keyPoints**: string, max 500 chars (optional)
- **propertyDescription**: string, max 2000 chars (optional)
- **targetBuyer**: enum ["jeune_famille", "professionnel", "retraite", "investisseur", "premier_acheteur", "famille_multigenerationnelle"] (required)
- **photos**: File[] array, max 20 files, max 10MB each (optional)

### Multipart/Form-Data Parsing
Common libraries for Vercel serverless functions:
- **formidable**: Lightweight, good for Vercel environment
- **multer**: More feature-rich but heavier
- Recommendation: Use formidable for this MVP

### Security Considerations
Based on security best practices and existing patterns:

**CORS Configuration**:
- Use `process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGIN` for production origin validation
- Set appropriate `Access-Control-Max-Age` header for preflight caching
- Match pattern from `/api/health.js`

**File Upload Security**:
- Validate MIME types: Accept only image formats (image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp)
- Enforce file size limits: Max 10MB per file, max 20 files total
- Implement rate limiting using Upstash Redis for serverless environments
- Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal attacks

**Input Validation**:
- Validate all required fields server-side
- Sanitize text inputs to prevent XSS/injection attacks
- Use Zod schema validation (matching frontend) for consistency

**Error Handling**:
- Return specific error codes for different failure scenarios:
  - 400: Bad request (validation failures)
  - 413: Payload too large
  - 415: Unsupported media type
  - 429: Rate limit exceeded
- Never expose internal error details to client

### Environment Configuration
Based on [Source: architecture/10-environment-configuration.md]:

Frontend will need VITE_API_URL environment variable configured.
Backend environment variables needed:
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`: Production origin for CORS validation
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`: Redis URL for rate limiting (optional for MVP)
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`: Redis token for rate limiting (optional for MVP)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment setting (development/production)

### Performance Considerations

**File Upload Optimization**:
- Consider streaming for large file uploads to reduce memory usage
- Process files asynchronously where possible
- Set appropriate timeout (30 seconds) for file processing

**Response Optimization**:
- Add compression for API responses (gzip)
- Include appropriate cache headers for OPTIONS preflight requests
- Implement request timeout handling on client side

**Error Recovery**:
- Implement exponential backoff for retries on transient failures
- Provide clear feedback during long upload operations
- Handle network interruptions gracefully

### File Locations
Based on [Source: architecture/3-project-structure.md]:

```
/api/                       # Root level API directory
├── health.js (existing)
└── dossier.js (new)

/src/
├── services/
│   ├── dossierService.ts (new)
│   └── dossierService.test.ts (new - test alongside service)
└── types/
    └── index.d.ts (update with DossierPostResponse type)

/__tests__/                 # Root level test directory for API tests
└── api/
    └── dossier.test.js (new - backend endpoint tests)
```

### Vercel Configuration
Based on existing vercel.json:
- Functions configured under "functions" key
- maxDuration can be set per function (health.js uses 10 seconds)
- For file uploads, may need 30-60 seconds maxDuration

## Testing

Based on [Source: architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]:

**Testing Requirements**:
- Frontend test files should be created alongside source files in src/
- Backend API tests should be in __tests__/api/ directory
- Use Vitest for unit tests
- Mock external dependencies (API calls) using MSW
- Focus on user behavior, not implementation
- Aim for minimum 80% code coverage

**Backend Testing**:
- Create __tests__/api/dossier.test.js for serverless function tests
- Test multipart parsing, validation, and response codes
- Test security features (CORS, rate limiting, file validation)
- Mock file upload scenarios with various file types
- Test all error response codes (400, 413, 415, 429)

**Frontend Testing**:
- Create src/services/dossierService.test.ts (alongside service file)
- Use MSW to mock API responses for all scenarios
- Test success and all error scenarios
- Verify proper error handling and retry logic
- Test timeout behavior for large uploads

- [ ] Environment variable ALLOWED_ORIGIN needs to be set in production

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- CORS properly configured with origin validation via environment variable
- File type validation prevents arbitrary file uploads
- File size limits prevent resource exhaustion (10MB per file, 20 files max)
- Input validation prevents missing required fields
- Proper error messages without exposing internal details

**Minor Concerns:**
- Rate limiting not yet implemented (marked as TODO in story tasks)
- No input sanitization for XSS prevention (though React handles this by default)

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Appropriate timeout configuration (30s for file uploads)
- CORS preflight caching (24 hours)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff prevents server overload
- FormData streaming for efficient file uploads

**Optimizations Applied:**
- None required - implementation is already optimized for typical use cases
