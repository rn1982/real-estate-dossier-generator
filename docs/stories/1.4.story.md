## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 implementation:
- Backend endpoint `/api/dossier` is fully functional and tested
- Endpoint accepts multipart/form-data with text fields and file uploads
- Returns 201 Created with response body containing submission details
- Error responses include specific codes (400, 413, 415, 429)
- `dossierService.ts` already implements submitDossier with retry logic
- `useDossierForm.ts` hook already handles form submission but uses browser alert()

### Current Implementation Status
Based on code review [Source: src/hooks/useDossierForm.ts:7-75]:
- ✅ Form submission logic exists and works (lines 24-70)
- ✅ FormData construction is implemented correctly (lines 31-45)
- ✅ Basic error handling is in place (lines 58-69)
- ⚠️ Uses browser alert() instead of proper UI components (lines 54, 68)
- ⚠️ No Toast/Alert components for user feedback
- ⚠️ Missing proper loading UI beyond button text change (line 25)
- ⚠️ No form persistence to localStorage

### UI Component Requirements
Based on [Source: architecture/4-component-standards.md:5-50]:

**Toast Component Structure**:
- Should be created in `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx`
- Use Radix UI Toast primitive for accessibility
- Style with Tailwind CSS using cva for variants
- Support success, error, warning, info variants
- Include auto-dismiss functionality
- Position fixed to top-right or bottom-center

**Component File Locations**:
```
src/components/ui/
├── Toast.tsx (new)
├── Alert.tsx (new - for inline messages)
└── LoadingSpinner.tsx (new - for button loading state)
```

### State Management Pattern
Based on [Source: architecture/5-state-management.md]:
- Form state managed by react-hook-form (already implemented in useDossierForm.ts:12-22)
- Server state should use TanStack Query for better loading/error management
- Currently using useState for submission state (useDossierForm.ts:8-10, works but not ideal)

### Validation Requirements
Based on [Source: src/types/dossierForm.ts:3-50]:

**Required Fields** (must show validation errors):
- agentEmail: Valid email format (lines 5-7)
- propertyType: Must be 'appartement' or 'maison' (lines 10-12)
- address: Non-empty string (line 13)
- price: Valid positive number string with regex validation (lines 14-16)
- targetBuyer: Must be one of predefined options (lines 35-44)

**Optional Fields** (validate only if provided):
- roomCount: Positive number, allows decimals (lines 17-19)
- livingArea: Positive number (lines 20-22)
- constructionYear: Between 1800 and current year (lines 23-26)
- keyPoints: Max 500 characters (lines 27-29)
- propertyDescription: Max 2000 characters (lines 30-32)
- photos: Max 20 files, max 10MB each, image types only (lines 47-49)

### Form Submission Flow
Current flow [Source: src/hooks/useDossierForm.ts:24-57]:
1. User clicks submit button
2. React Hook Form validates via Zod schema (line 12-22)
3. If valid, handleSubmit converts to FormData (line 24-45)
4. Calls submitDossierWithRetry from service (line 48)
5. Shows browser alert on success/error (line 54, 68)
6. Resets form on success (line 57)

**Enhanced Flow Required**:
1. User clicks submit button
2. Real-time validation shows inline errors
3. Button shows loading spinner, form inputs disabled
4. Submit to API with progress indication
5. Show Toast notification on success/error
6. Keep form data in localStorage until success
7. Reset form and clear localStorage on success
8. Show "Submit another" option

### Security Considerations
**Form Data Handling**:
- Input sanitization: All text inputs must be sanitized before submission to prevent XSS attacks
- File validation: Verify file MIME types on client-side before upload (not just extension)
- LocalStorage security: 
  - Never store sensitive data (passwords, tokens) in localStorage
  - Encrypt form data if storing sensitive information temporarily
  - Clear localStorage immediately after successful submission
  - Add expiry timestamp to stored data (24 hour max)

**API Communication**:
- Always use HTTPS for form submission (enforced by VITE_API_URL)
- Implement CSRF protection if not already present
- Rate limiting is handled by backend (429 responses)

### Performance Requirements
**Target Metrics**:
- Form input responsiveness: <100ms lag for user typing
- LocalStorage debounce: 500ms for auto-save operations  
- Toast auto-dismiss: 5000ms (5 seconds) for success messages
- File upload feedback: Update progress every 250ms for large files
- Form validation feedback: <50ms for inline field validation
- Submit button state change: Immediate (<16ms) visual feedback

### Testing Standards
Based on [Source: architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]:

**Test File Locations**:
```
src/hooks/useDossierForm.test.ts (alongside hook file)
src/components/features/DossierForm.test.tsx (alongside component)
src/components/ui/Toast.test.tsx (alongside component)
```

**Testing Tools**:
- Vitest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- MSW for mocking API responses
- Aim for 80% code coverage minimum

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. Successful form submission with all fields
2. Validation prevents submission with missing required fields
3. Network error shows retry option
4. File size/type validation works
5. Form persistence across page reloads
6. Success message auto-dismisses after timeout
7. Security: XSS prevention in text inputs
8. Security: localStorage expiry and cleanup

### Environment Configuration
Based on [Source: architecture/10-environment-configuration.md]:
- VITE_API_URL already configured in environment
- No additional environment variables needed for this story

- [ ] Replace `any` types in test files with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Investigate test suite timeout issues

### Security Review

**Strong security implementation:**
- Input validation via Zod prevents injection attacks
- File upload validation (MIME type and size checks)
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- Proper error messages prevent information disclosure
- HTTPS enforcement through environment configuration

**Minor recommendations:**
- Consider adding Content Security Policy headers
- Additional server-side file validation recommended

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent performance optimizations:**
- 500ms debounced validation prevents excessive re-renders
- Proper React Hook Form integration for optimized form state
- LocalStorage operations debounced to minimize I/O
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
- Auto-dismiss timers properly cleaned up

**Future considerations:**
- Bundle size analysis for toast components
- Performance monitoring for submission times

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review - the implementation quality did not require intervention.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.4-implement-form-submission-logic.yml

The CONCERNS gate is due to minor linting errors that should be resolved before production deployment. The implementation itself is of exceptional quality.

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]

While the implementation is excellent, the linting errors (2 errors) must be fixed before marking as Done. These are trivial fixes:
1. Remove unused `fs` import in api/dossier.js
2. Change `let` to `const` in dossierService.test.ts:260
3. Consider replacing `any` types in test files for better type safety

Once these minor issues are resolved, this story is ready for production.
