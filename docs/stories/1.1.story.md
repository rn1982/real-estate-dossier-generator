# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Health Check

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to set up the initial project structure and dependencies with a basic health-check endpoint,  
**so that** we have a stable, verifiable foundation to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Single Repository is created in version control.
2. The chosen Serverless framework and frontend framework are installed and configured.
3. A basic health-check endpoint (e.g., GET /health) is created and deployed.
4. The health-check endpoint returns a 200 OK status when called.
5. (New Sub-task) A README.md file is created with setup instructions and a "Prerequisites" section.
6. (New Sub-task) All project dependencies are installed via npm install.

## Dev Notes

### Framework & Technology Stack
Based on the architecture documentation, this project uses:

**Core Framework:**
- Vite + React (5.2.x + 18.3.x) - Fast development build tool with React framework
- TypeScript (5.4.x) - Static typing for code quality and bug reduction

**UI & Styling:**
- Tailwind CSS (3.4.x) - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- Radix UI (1.1.x) - Headless, accessible component primitives (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- class-variance-authority (cva) - For component style variants
- Framer Motion (11.2.x) - UI animations
- react-feather (4.29.x) - Icon library

**Form Handling & State Management:**
- React Hook Form (7.51.x) - High-performance form state management
- react-dropzone (14.2.x) - File upload handling
- TanStack Query - Server state management
- React Hooks (built-in) - Local state management
- Zod - Schema validation

**Development Tools:**
- Vitest (1.6.x) + React Testing Library (15.0.x) - Testing framework
- ESLint (8.57.x) + Prettier (3.2.x) - Code quality and formatting

### Project Structure Standards
The project follows a refined directory structure with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI primitives (Button, Input, etc.)
│   ├── layout/       # Layout components (PageWrapper, etc.)
│   └── features/     # Smart business components (DossierForm, etc.)
├── services/         # API integration functions
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── config/           # Application configuration (env.ts)
├── types/            # Shared TypeScript definitions
├── lib/              # Utility functions and library configurations
└── styles/           # Global CSS and styling
```

### Component Architecture Standards
- **UI Primitives**: Stateless, reusable components using cva template for style variants
- **Layout Components**: Simple arrangement and page structure components  
- **Feature Components**: Smart components containing business logic and state

### Environment & Configuration
- Use src/config/env.ts for type-safe environment variable handling
- Path alias @/ configured for src/ directory access
- All environment variables must be accessed through the type-safe env object

### Serverless Architecture
- Deploy using Vercel for automatic GitHub integration
- Health check endpoint should be implemented as Vercel serverless function
- API endpoints follow /api/* pattern for Vercel functions

### Deployment Configuration
**Vercel Setup:**
- Create `vercel.json` in project root with the following configuration:
  ```json
  {
    "functions": {
      "api/health.js": {
        "maxDuration": 10
      }
    },
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "outputDirectory": "dist",
    "installCommand": "npm install"
  }
  ```
- **Environment Variables:** Configure in Vercel dashboard (Settings > Environment Variables)
- **Build Commands:** 
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Output Directory: `dist`
  - Install: `npm install`

### Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Package Management
- **Lock File:** Commit `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent dependency versions
- **Node Version:** Create `.nvmrc` file with Node version 20.x (LTS)
- **Engines Field:** Add to package.json:
  ```json
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.0.0",
    "npm": ">=10.0.0"
  }
  ```

### Git Hooks Configuration (Optional Enhancement)
- Install husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
  npx husky init
  ```
- Configure in package.json:
  ```json
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.{json,md,css}": ["prettier --write"]
  }
  ```

## Testing

All testing should follow these standards from the architecture:

**Testing Framework:** Vitest + React Testing Library (RTL)
- **Test Location:** Tests should be co-located with components or in __tests__ directories
- **Testing Philosophy:** Focus on user behavior and component integration rather than implementation details
- **Key Patterns:** 
  - Use RTL queries (getByRole, getByLabelText, etc.) over getElementById
  - Test user interactions and component behavior
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls in services/
- **File Naming:** Component tests should be named `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- **Commands:** Use `npm run test` to run the test suite
- **Coverage:** Aim for 80% code coverage on critical paths

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- **Never commit `.env` files** - Add to `.gitignore`:
  ```
  .env
  .env.local
  .env.*.local
  ```
- **Type-safe access:** Use `src/config/env.ts` with Zod validation:
  ```typescript
  import { z } from 'zod';
  
  const envSchema = z.object({
    VITE_API_URL: z.string().url(),
    // Add other env vars as needed
  });
  
  export const env = envSchema.parse(import.meta.env);
  ```

### CORS Configuration
- Configure CORS headers in Vercel functions:
  ```javascript
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGIN || '*');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS');
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
  }
  ```

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Validate all inputs using Zod schemas
- Never expose sensitive keys in client-side code
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
