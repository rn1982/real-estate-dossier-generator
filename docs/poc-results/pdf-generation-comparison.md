# PDF Generation PoC Results & Recommendation

## Executive Summary

After evaluating three PDF generation approaches, **Puppeteer** is selected as the primary solution with **Carbone.io** planned as a premium feature post-MVP.

## PoC Results

### 1. Puppeteer with @sparticuz/chromium ✅ SELECTED

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Successfully generated professional PDF
- ✅ Generation time: 3.1 seconds
- ✅ Memory usage: +9MB
- ✅ File size: 2.8MB
- ✅ Quality: Professional, pixel-perfect

**Strengths:**
- Full HTML/CSS support
- Perfect French typography
- Complete design flexibility
- Zero per-document cost

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires 1GB memory on Vercel
- 3-5 second generation time
- Template editing requires technical knowledge

### 2. React PDF (@react-pdf/renderer) ❌ NOT PURSUED

**Decision:** Skipped after Puppeteer success

**Reasoning:**
- Limited CSS support incompatible with professional templates
- No HTML support (requires complete rewrite)
- Less flexibility than Puppeteer
- Not suitable for agent template customization

### 3. External Service (PDFShift/Carbone.io) ⏰ DEFERRED

**Decision:** Reserved for Phase 2 premium features

**Planned Implementation:**
- Carbone.io selected for visual template designer
- Target: Story 2.4 (post-MVP)
- Positioning: Premium feature (€29/month tier)

## Final Architecture Decision

### MVP (Story 2.3)
```
Puppeteer + Template Presets + CSS Variables
- 5 professional templates
- Color/logo customization
- Basic layout options
- Cost: $0 per document
```

### Phase 2 (Story 2.4)
```
Hybrid: Puppeteer (Basic) + Carbone.io (Premium)
- Visual template designer
- Upload existing templates
- Advanced customization
- Cost: €0.01-0.03 per document (premium only)
```

## Performance Metrics

| Generation Time | <5s | 3.1s | ✅ Pass |
| Memory Usage | <1GB | ~900MB | ✅ Pass |

2. **Brand Colors:** 3 customizable colors
