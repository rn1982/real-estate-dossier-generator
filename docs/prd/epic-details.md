# Epic Details

## Epic 1: Foundational Data Capture & Pipeline

**Goal:** To build the core "walking skeleton" of the application, validating the entire data pipeline from form submission to email confirmation.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup & Health Check

**As a developer,** I want to set up the initial project structure and dependencies with a basic health-check endpoint, so that we have a stable, verifiable foundation to build upon.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A new Single Repository is created in version control.
- The chosen Serverless framework and frontend framework are installed and configured.
- A basic health-check endpoint (e.g., GET /health) is created and deployed.
- The health-check endpoint returns a 200 OK status when called.
- (New Sub-task) A README.md file is created with setup instructions and a "Prerequisites" section.
- (New Sub-task) All project dependencies are installed via npm install.

### Story 1.2: Build the Property Data Submission Form UI

**As a real estate agent,** I want a single-page web form with all the necessary fields, so that I can easily input all property information in one place.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A responsive, single-page web form is created.
- The form includes all required text input fields, a "Target Buyer" dropdown, and a file input control.
- A "Submit" button is present.
- The form must include a mandatory, validated text input field for 'Agent Email Address'.
- (New Sub-task) Basic, privacy-focused analytics (e.g., Vercel Analytics) are integrated.

### Story 1.3: Create Backend Endpoint to Receive Form Data

**As a developer,** I want a secure serverless endpoint that can receive the property data, so that the web form has a destination for the submitted information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A new serverless function/endpoint is created to handle POST requests.
- The endpoint is configured to receive multipart/form-data.
- The endpoint successfully logs received text content and file metadata.
- The endpoint returns a success response (e.g., 201 Created).

### Story 1.4: Implement Form Submission Logic

**As a real estate agent,** I want to press the "Submit" button and have my data sent to the backend, so that my information is captured for processing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Client-side logic is added to the "Submit" button.
- All form data is sent to the backend endpoint.
- Client-side validation for required fields is implemented.
- A "Submission Confirmation" message is displayed on successful submission.

### Story 1.5: Implement Email Notification with Raw Data

**As a developer,** I want the backend service to send a simple email containing the submitted raw data, so that the end-to-end data pipeline is complete and verifiable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- An email service is integrated into the backend.
- The backend triggers an email to the agent's provided address.
- The email body contains all submitted text data and a confirmation of photos received.
- (New Sub-task) The final copy for this confirmation email is drafted and approved.

### Story 1.6 (New): Configure CI/CD Pipeline

**As a developer,** I want to configure the Vercel-GitHub integration, so that the application is deployed automatically on every push to the main branch.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The project's GitHub repository is linked to a Vercel project.
- A push to the main branch automatically triggers a new deployment.
- The deployed application is accessible via its .vercel.app URL.

### Story 1.7 (New): Configure Error Tracking

**As a developer,** I want to integrate a lightweight error tracking service (e.g., Sentry), so that we are proactively alerted to any production bugs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- An error tracking service SDK is added to the project.
- The service is initialized with a key from environment variables.
- A test error is successfully captured in the service's dashboard.

## Epic 2: AI Content Enrichment & Professional Dossier Generation

**Goal:** To integrate the AI and Document Generation APIs, transforming the captured data into a high-quality PDF dossier and social media snippets.

### Story 2.1: Integrate AI Service for Content Generation

**As a developer,** I want to send the captured property data to the approved AI service, so that I can automatically generate a property narrative and social media snippets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The backend process calls the approved AI service.
- Property data is passed to the AI in the required format.
- The AI's response is successfully received and logged.
- Error handling for AI service failures is implemented.

### Story 2.2: Execute Document Generation API Proof of Concept (PoC)

**As an architect,** I want to execute a PoC on the top candidate for the document generation API, so that I can make an evidence-based decision on the best technology.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Top candidate APIs are tested with a final design template.
- A report is produced comparing the candidates.
- A final API is officially selected and approved.

### Story 2.3: Integrate Approved Document Generation API

**As a developer,** I want to integrate the approved document generation service, so that a high-quality PDF dossier is created.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The selected Document Generation API is integrated into the backend.
- A data payload with property details and AI text is sent to the API.
- The API successfully generates a PDF matching the PoC quality.
- The generated PDF is temporarily stored in a secure location.

### Story 2.4: Update Email Service to Deliver Final Assets

**As a real estate agent,** I want to receive a final email containing the beautiful PDF dossier and all related marketing content, so that I can immediately begin marketing my property.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The email functionality from Story 1.5 is modified.
- The final email attaches the generated PDF.
- The email body includes the AI-generated social media snippets.
- The email fulfills FR8 by including all generated text in an easily editable format.
- (New Sub-task) The final copy for this delivery email is drafted and approved.
