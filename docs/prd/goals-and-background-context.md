# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Validate the core value proposition with a functional MVP that agents find valuable.
- Reduce dossier creation time from over an hour to less than 10 minutes.
- Deliver marketing materials that agents perceive as a significant improvement in quality.
- Achieve high user satisfaction through a simple and efficient form-to-email workflow.

## Background Context

In the competitive real estate market, agents need to market properties quickly and effectively. A key part of this is the property selling dossier, but the current creation process is manual, time-consuming, and often results in generic, low-impact documents.

The proposed solution is an AI-powered platform that automates the generation of professionally designed, "design agency" quality PDF dossiers and associated social media content from a simple web form. By delivering a superior visual product and AI-generated marketing copy in under 5 minutes, this service will save agents significant time, enhance their professional image, and improve their marketing impact.
