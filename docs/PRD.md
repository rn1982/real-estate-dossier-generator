# AI Real Estate Dossier Generator Product Requirements Document (PRD) - (Revised)

**Version:** 1.2  
**Date:** August 21, 2025

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Validate the core value proposition with a functional MVP that agents find valuable.
- Reduce dossier creation time from over an hour to less than 10 minutes.
- Deliver marketing materials that agents perceive as a significant improvement in quality.
- Achieve high user satisfaction through a simple and efficient form-to-email workflow.
- Establish an initial user base of 3-5 partner agencies on a subscription model.
- Create a stable, low-maintenance product foundation.

### Background Context

In the competitive real estate market, agents need to market properties quickly and effectively. A key part of this is the property selling dossier, but the current creation process is manual, time-consuming, and often results in generic, low-impact documents.

The proposed solution is an AI-powered platform that automates the generation of professionally designed, "design agency" quality PDF dossiers and associated social media content from a simple web form. By delivering a superior visual product and AI-generated marketing copy in under 5 minutes, this service will save agents significant time, enhance their professional image, and improve their marketing impact.

## Epic Details

### Epic 1: Foundational Data Capture & Pipeline

**Goal:** To build the core "walking skeleton" of the application, validating the entire data pipeline from form submission to email confirmation.

#### Story 1.1: Project Setup & Health Check

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A new Single Repository is created in version control.
- The chosen Serverless framework and frontend framework are installed and configured.
- A basic health-check endpoint (e.g., GET /health) is created and deployed.
- The health-check endpoint returns a 200 OK status when called.
- (New Sub-task) A README.md file is created with setup instructions and a "Prerequisites" section.
- (New Sub-task) All project dependencies are installed via npm install.

#### Story 1.2: Build the Property Data Submission Form UI
