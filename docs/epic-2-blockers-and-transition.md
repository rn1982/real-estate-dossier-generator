# Epic 2 Transition Checklist & Blockers

## Identified Blockers for Epic 2

### üî¥ Critical Blockers
**NONE IDENTIFIED** - Ready to proceed with Epic 2

### üü° Non-Blocking Issues

1. **Production Health Endpoint Error**
   - **Issue:** `/api/health` returning FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED in production
   - **Impact:** Non-critical, monitoring only
   - **Recommendation:** Fix in parallel with Epic 2 work

2. **Test Suite Failures (42% failure rate)**
   - **Issue:** UI component tests and MSW mock handlers outdated
   - **Impact:** Reduces confidence in automated testing
   - **Recommendation:** Fix incrementally during Epic 2

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Actions Before Starting Epic 2

#### High Priority
1. **Manual E2E Test on Production**
   ```bash
   # Test the full flow on https://real-estate-dossier-generator.vercel.app
   # 1. Fill out form with test data
   # 2. Upload test images
   # 3. Submit and verify email receipt
   ```

2. **Fix Production Health Endpoint**
   - Debug Sentry wrapper issue in production
   - May need to check Vercel environment variables

#### Medium Priority
3. **Update Test Mocks**
   - Fix MSW handlers in `src/__mocks__`
   - Update form integration tests

4. **Clean Up Deployments**
   - Configure Vercel to use single project
   - Remove duplicate deployments as noted in CLAUDE.md

#### Low Priority
5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Add completion status to story files
   - Archive Epic 1 artifacts

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- All Epic 1 acceptance criteria met
- Core infrastructure stable
- No blocking dependencies

### Medium Risk
- Test coverage gaps may hide issues
- Production health endpoint needs fixing

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Extensive manual testing before Epic 2
2. Fix critical issues in parallel
3. Implement feature flags for new AI features

## Recommended Team Actions

### For Developer
1. Fix production health endpoint
2. Run manual E2E test
3. Begin AI service research for Story 2.1

### For Product Owner
1. Review and approve AI service selection criteria
2. Define quality metrics for generated content
3. Prepare acceptance criteria for PDF output

### For QA
1. Create Epic 2 test scenarios
2. Prepare AI content validation criteria
3. Set up PDF quality checks

## Conclusion

Epic 1 is successfully completed with a stable foundation. The application has a working end-to-end pipeline from form submission to email delivery. All critical features are operational in production.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Epic 2 immediately while addressing non-blocking issues in parallel.

**Next Immediate Action:** Run manual E2E test on production to validate full flow.
